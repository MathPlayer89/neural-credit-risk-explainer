# \# Neural Credit Risk Explainer

# 

# This is the final deep learning project for my Advanced Topics in Machine Learning course at URI. The objective is to build a credit risk classification model using a feedforward neural network trained on tabular financial data.

# 

# \### üîç Project Goals

# \- Classify customers as high vs low credit risk

# \- Use SHAP to interpret and explain predictions

# \- Optionally generate natural-language rationales via a small LLM

# 

# \### üì¶ Dataset

# \- \*\*Source\*\*: \[Credit Score Classification ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification)

# \- \*\*Files\*\*: `data/train.csv`, `data/test.csv`

# \- \*\*Target\*\*: `Credit\_Score` (mapped to binary: Poor = 1, Standard/Good = 0)

# 

# More detailed project proposal coming soon.
